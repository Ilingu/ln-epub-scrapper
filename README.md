# Go ePub Scrapper üìú

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Little **[Perpetualdaydreams's**](https://perpetualdaydreams.com/) Scrapper that transform light novels in `.epub` files

## Purpose:

‚ùå I would not recommend you to use this. Since it's not the purpose of this project. I was just frustated whenever I go to this website that I couldn't download any epub. I don't know if this works for all novels. At the beginning I didn't want to put this project on my Github, but since it's a great way to show my skills, I still put it on my Github as a showcase.

Moreover, there is a risk to be IP ban by Perpetualdaydreams if you use this service.

## Made with:

1. `Elegance` ‚ú®
2. `Go` ‚ö°
3. `Rod` for the automated browser (like pupputeer but in Go)
4. `go-epub` little library to easily create ePubs from HTML

## Usage

‚û°Ô∏è Downlaod the `.exe` in the Releases. (It _should_ works with all OS)
‚û°Ô∏è Type:

```bash
$ epub-scrapper.exe -h # To see the configuration (don't mind the "rod" option)
```
